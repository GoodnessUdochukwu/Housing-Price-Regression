# Housing-Price-Regression
This project utilizes housing features to develop a regression model for predicting housing prices.

The Regressors utilized for this project are;

Decision Tree Regressor.
Linear Regression.
Random Forest Regressor.
KNeighbours Regressor.
Regression with RFECV using Decision Tree Regressor, Extra Tree Regressor, and AdaBoost Regressor.

Data Preprocessing was done by visualizations, cleaning, imputting missing values, and scaling in some cases, to minimize outlier effects.

Categorical encoding of type Onehot and Ordinal was also used.

Different pipelines were created to handle categorical and numerical features, and finally, the grid search cross validation iterator was used to ensure our model predicts without overfitting.
